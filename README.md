# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake Account Detection
A machine learning project to detect fake or fraudulent user accounts on a platform based on behavioral, profile, and activity-based features. This project aims to enhance online platform integrity by identifying suspicious patterns and flagging fake accounts using various classification algorithms.


# 🚀 Introduction
Fake or bot accounts can pose serious threats to online platforms by spamming, phishing, and spreading misinformation. This project focuses on detecting such accounts using machine learning techniques, thereby improving platform security and user experience.

# 🧠 Problem Statement
Detect and classify user accounts as real or fake based on various attributes such as:

Account creation metadata

Profile completeness

Activity patterns

Social network connections

Textual/behavioral patterns

# 🧾 Features
Here are a few sample features used:

account_age_days

num_followers

num_following

profile_description_length

num_posts

has_profile_picture (boolean)

engagement_rate

You can modify this list based on your actual dataset

# 🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost / Random Forest / Logistic Regression

Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)

Streamlit (optional for demo UI)

Jupyter Notebook

# 📈 Modeling & Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified feature distributions and class imbalances.

Feature Engineering: Created new features like engagement ratio, profile completeness score.

Model Training: Used multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
